# keras-fine-tune-inception
Fine tuning inception v3 on Kaggle dogs-vs-cats dataset.

This is a combination of Keras blog tutorial (https://blog.keras.io/building-powerful-image-classification-models-using-very-little-data.html) on fine tuning VGG 16 nets and some guidance from keras tuning project (https://github.com/danielvarga/keras-finetuning).
